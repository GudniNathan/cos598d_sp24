Alright, we need to get this sucker done.


What do we have already?
- Data parallelism - three methods: 
    - manual sync,
    - all-reduce sync, and
    - DDP (distribute data parallel)

What are we going to actually do?

So, the original project proposal talked about specifically FSDP and ZeRO.

What would we need to do to implement FSDP?
    - It seems like it is just practically a drop in replacement?
    - What about the different levels of the model?
    - How do I tell each instance that it is running only these specific layers?


What would we need to implement ZeRO
    - Research, what is ZeRO actually? 
    - I know that it is something like pipeline parallel.

Perhaps it would be more prudent to simply use Pytorch Pipeline Parallel.

So overall.

1. Figure out FSDP. How does it work? What is it? Can I split the model up?
